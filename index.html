          <p>This paper details ways that North Carolina Community Colleges can improve retention by investigating curriculum completion and success in students’ first year of college. A complete repository of data from community colleges in North Carolina was built for this analysis featuring 1950 variables related to the colleges and their surrounding communities from five main publicly available data sources. Leading factors were identified to help explain why one-third of students in North Carolina community colleges do not return for their second year of college. Our research revealed that racial demographics along with success from educationally at risk, English as a Second Language (ESL) individuals receiving Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) services are leading factors to predicting retention. Our research uses elastic net regularized regression techniques to determine the feature importance of variables connected to students’ success in their first year of college.</p>

          <p>In free societies, the duration of COVID-19, in theory, will depend on how compliant people are, and for how long. It is a safe assumption to say that the more authoritative regimes are going to have moresuccess at social distancing. Thus, this has appeared to be successful in China, if their numbers areaccurate. Western countries are less adept at having a restriction on their civil liberties, even in a time of pandemic crisis. No government other than the most repressive will believe it can keep its country on lockdown for months on end — and even if it could, the economic effects would be intolerable. This project compares trends in China and the United States based on when restrictions were put into place. Since this analysis was completed in April 2020, the COVID-19 data may not be up to date.</p>

        <p>It is crucial to understand and respect data privacy in this age of big data. With new laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), it is more important than ever to protect consumer privacy. In this project, I leveraged the anonymization methods of k-Anonymization and i-Diversity to modify sensitive data yielding results with true anonymity within a 95% confidence interval of the original data.
